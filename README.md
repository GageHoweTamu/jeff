# jeff

jeff is a command-line ai unlike any other. He's like your unstable uncle except he lives inside your computer and is a bash expert.

``` bash
jeff setup
jeff "hi jeff"
jeff "what directory am I in?"
jeff "compile this pls" ~/Downloads/hi.cpp
```

jeff clarifies if the command is potentially dangerous: y/N:
jeff runs a command if you ask him to
jeff outputs the command output
jeff provides a concise summary of what he did

jeff uses the chatGPT api plus some pre-prompting trickery
